                <p class="compare-p">
                  The decision support systems option educates the student in the design, implementation and use of computerized systems
                  that support business managers in the decision-making process. A decision support system (DSS) is a computer system that
                  typically encompasses mathematical models as well as informational databases and a user interface in order to provide
                  recommended decisions to manager-users.
                </p>
                <p class="compare-p">
                  A DSS differs from a traditional information system (IS) or manage<wbr />ment information system (MIS)
                  in that it not only provides the user with information, databases or reports, as does an IS or MIS, but it also provides answers to user
                  queries, i.e., decisions, through its modeling component. In essence a DSS is a computer system that helps managers make decisions.

                <p class="compare-p">
                  <mark>The job market for graduates of the DSS option is excellent.</mark> Over 100 companies and government organizations annually
                  interview BIT seniors. DSS graduates typically obtain jobs in the information technology field. Job titles include consultant,
                  technical consultant, systems analyst, systems developer, network administrator, manage<wbr />ment analyst, programmer analyst,
                  project analyst, database developer, software developer, programming consultant, information manager, applications developer,
                  and information manage<wbr />ment consultant, among many others.

                <p class="compare-p">
                  The operations and supply chain manage<wbr />ment (OSM) option is designed to teach our students how to manage operations in business and government.
                  An operation is the process by which a company or organization converts raw materials, labor and capital into a final product or service.
                  In an automobile company, for example, materials and labor are transformed by manufacturing operations into cars. In a hospital, nurses
                  and doctors use medicines, care and equipment to help sick patients become healthy.
                </p>
                <p class="compare-p">
                  In a bank, staff members use computers and systems to
                  manage the flow of money among accounts and provide customers with statements and other banking services. Whatever the operation, decisions
                  have to be made to establish work schedules for employees, forecast demand for products and services, improve and maintain quality, ensure
                  adequate inventory, transport and store products and materials, and order materials and parts.
                  These all require operational decisions that can be made using the managerial techniques and computing technologies taught in the OSM option of our major.
                </p>
                <p class="compare-p">
                  <mark>The job opportunities for OSM option graduates are also excellent.</mark> There is a general shortage of qualified graduates in the
                  operations manage<wbr />ment area, thus our OSM option graduates are in high-demand. OSM option graduates are sometimes hired directly
                  into manage<wbr />ment positions but most frequently they are hired into manage<wbr />ment or staff training positions.
                </p>
                <aside class="compare-p">
                  Following training OSM majors are typically placed into supervisory or department head positions wherein they manage and oversee specific company operations.
                  Alternatively they may be placed into staff positions where they are involved with company-wide operational decisions.
